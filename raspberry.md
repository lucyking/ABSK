# Obtian Raw Deepth Data on ARM-arch System With Raspberry Pi 3

## Introduction
Raspberry Pi is an open source ARM based develop board.Since distribute on 2010,It has been implenented on several scinece and industrial fields.Such as 3D printer,automatic control in factory,automatic robot,etc.

On the hardware aspect.Compared with the triditilal computer,Raspberr Pi has little size and less power consumption,which just need 5V power supply.As to ST's stm32 or TI's msp430 serials SOC chips,Raspberry Pi has advanced hardware so can run the whole Linux operate system,so it can debug directly on the board,that will save a lot of time than other chips which need fire/flash the built binary to them.

As for the Software environment.Raspberry Pi has lots of 3rd party library and device driver.These source will do developers a favor during coding and make all the thing easier.

Kinect is a 3D camera of Microsoft.It can obtian both RGB and infrared depth image data with each cameras.It has a Prime Sense's PS1080-A2 image processor to analyse people's movition,  As the X853750001 / VCA379C7130 is used to generate the depth date,etc(芯片功能介绍)
